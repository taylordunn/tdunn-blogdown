The purpose of this post is to learn about ordinal regression models (a.k.a. cumulative link, proportional odds, ordered logit models, etc.) and practice their implementation.
This is part 1, where I'll be taking the frequentist approach via the [`ordinal` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ordinal/index.html).
There are other options, like `MASS::polr`, but two features in particular drew me to `ordinal`: (1) it allows for random effects, and (2) it has [`broom::tidy` methods](https://rdrr.io/cran/broom/man/ordinal_tidiers.html) available.

Particularly, I'll be following along with

* this excellent [primer](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/pkg/ordinal/inst/doc/primer.pdf?revision=66&root=ordinal&pathrev=69) which includes theory and application, and
* this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ordinal/vignettes/clmm2_tutorial.pdf) which is a tutorial on incorporating random effects.

# Setup

Import the usual suspects and set the `ggplot2` theme:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(broom)
library(patchwork)
library(here)

# Set ggplot2 theme and defaults
theme_set(cowplot::theme_cowplot() + cowplot::background_grid(major = "xy"))
ggp <- function(...) ggplot(...) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

Import `ordinal`, and the included data set `wine`:

```{r}
library(ordinal)
data(wine)
wine <- as_tibble(wine)
glimpse(wine)
```

`wine` is a data set of wine bitterness ratings from multiple judges.
The variables are as follows:

* Outcome:
    * `response`: wine bitterness rating on a 0-100 scale
    * `rating`: ordered factor with 5 levels (grouped version of `response`) with 1 = "least bitter" and 5 = "most bitter"
* Treatment factors:
    * `temp`: temperature during wine production (`r str_c(unique(wine$temp), collapse = " and ")`)
    * `contact`: contact between juice and skins during wine production (`r str_c(unique(wine$contact), collapse = " and ")`)
* Random effects
    * `bottle` with `r nlevels(wine$bottle)` levels
    * `judge` with `r nlevels(wine$judge)` levels

Relationship between `response` and `rating`:

```{r}
wine %>%
  ggp(aes(x = rating, y = response)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter()
```


Note that there is no overlap between the levels.

There are `r nrow(wine)` total observations with the following ratings distribution by treatment and random effects:

```{r}
wine %>%
  select(temp, contact, bottle, judge, rating) %>%
  spread(judge, rating) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_spanner(columns = vars(`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`),
              label = "judge")
```

So each `bottle` had a particular `temp` and `contact` (2 bottles for each of the 4 combinations), and each `judge` rated each bottle.

Before modeling, can we see a clear effect of `temp` and `contact`?

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
wine %>%
  count(contact, rating, temp) %>%
  mutate(temp = fct_rev(temp)) %>%
  ggp(aes(x = contact, y = rating, color = temp)) +
  geom_point(aes(group = temp, size = n), position = position_dodge(1)) +
  cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid() +
  facet_wrap(~contact, scales = "free_x") +
  theme(
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_size(breaks = c(1, 2, 4, 6, 8))
```

At a glance, it looks like the `temp` = warm and `contact` = yes is associated with higher `rating`s.

# The cumulative link model

## Theory

The ordinal response $y_i$ falls into response category $j$ (out of $J$ total) with probability $\pi_{ij}$.
The cumulative probabilities are defined:

$$
P(y_i \leq j) = \pi_{i1} + \dots + \pi_{ij}.
$$

As an oversimplification, suppose that each probability $\pi_{ij}$ is equal to the proportion of that response in the `wine` data.
Then the cumulative "probability" can be visualized:

```{r fig.width=10}
wine_prop <- wine %>%
  count(rating) %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n),
         cumsum_p = cumsum(p))
(
ggp(wine_prop, aes(x = rating, y = p)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(x = "j", y = "proportion") +
  cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid()
) +
  (
    ggp(wine_prop, aes(x = as.integer(rating), y = cumsum_p)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      labs(x = "j", y = "cumulative proportion") +
      cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid()
  ) +
  (
    ggp(wine_prop,
        aes(x = as.integer(rating), y = log(cumsum_p) - log(1 - cumsum_p))) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      labs(x = "j", y = "logit(cumulative proportion)") +
      cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid()
  )
```

We will explore other links, but first the most common, the logit link, which is depicted in the right-most panel of the above figure:

$$
\text{logit} (P(y_i \leq j) = \log \frac{P(y_i \leq j)}{1 - P(y_i \leq j)}
$$

Note that the above function is defined for all but the last category $j = J$, because $1 - P(Y_i \leq J) = 1 - 1 = 0$.

For the `wine` data, where we have $J$ = 5 rating categories, we will build up to the following mixed effects model:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(p(y_i \leq j)) &= \theta_j - \beta_1 \text{temp}_i - \beta_2 \text{contact}_i - u( \text{judge}_i) \\
i &= 1, \dots n \; \; \; \; \; \; j = 1, \dots, J - 1
\end{align}
$$

where $\theta_j$ is called the threshold parameter, or cutpoint, of category $j$.
These thresholds can also be thought of as $J-1$ = 4 intercepts.
Note that the fixed effect parameters $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are independent of $j$, so each $\beta$ has the same effect for each of the $J-1$ cumulative logits.
The judge effects, which are also independent of $j$, are assumed normal: $u(\text{judge}_i) \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$.
We are using the logit link because it is the most popular for this kind of model (and the one I am familiar with), but there are other options we will briefly explore later.

The subtraction of terms in the above model is new to me.
The main reason seems to be for familiar interpretation: the larger the value of any independent term $\beta x$, the smaller the thresholds $\theta_j$, and therefore a larger probability of the a response falling into a category at the upper end of the scale.
This way, $\beta$ has the same *direction* of effect as in ordinary linear regression.

We are essentially modeling a "chain" of logistic regressions where the binary response is "less than or equal to a certain level" vs "greater than that level".
In this case, with $J$ = 5, the thresholds $\theta_j$ are capturing the adjusted log-odds of observing:

* $j$ = 1: log-odds of `rating` = 1 vs. 2-5
* $j$ = 2: log-odds of `rating` = 1-2 vs. 3-5
* $j$ = 3: log-odds of `rating` = 1-3 vs. 4-5
* $j$ = 4: log-odds of `rating` = 1-4 vs. 5

## Fitting

Now with a surface-level understanding of what is being modeled, we will fit the data using `ordinal::clm` (cumulative link models) and `ordinal::clmm` (cumulative link mixed models), and logit links.

### Fixed effects model

First, fit a simple model, by maximum likelihood, with `contact` as the sole predictor:

$$
\text{logit}(p(y_i \leq j)) = \theta_j - \beta_2 \text{contact}_i
$$

```{r}
clm_rating_contact <-
  clm(
    rating ~ contact,
    data = wine, link = "logit"
  )
summary(clm_rating_contact)
```

The model gives us $K - 1 = 4$ threshold coefficients, as expected.
The $\beta_2$ coefficient estimate was statistically significant (by a Wald test), and tells us that `contact` = yes *decreases* the thresholds $\theta_j$ by $\beta_2$ = `r round(tidy(clm_rating_contact)$estimate[5], 2)` (because of the subtraction of model terms), and therefore is associated with *higher* `rating`s.

The condition number of the Hessian for this model is `r round(clm_rating_contact$cond.H, 2)`.
The primer says that larger values (like > `1e4`) might indicate that the model is ill-defined.

It is nicely illustrative to compare this model to 4 separate logistic regressions with a dichotomized response:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit} (p(y_i \leq 1)) = \theta_1 + \beta_2 \text{contact_i} \\
\text{logit} (p(y_i \leq 2)) = \theta_2 + \beta_2 \text{contact_i} \\
\text{logit} (p(y_i \leq 3)) = \theta_3 + \beta_2 \text{contact_i} \\
\text{logit} (p(y_i \leq 4)) = \theta_4 + \beta_2 \text{contact_i} \\
\end{align}
$$

```{r warning=F}
wine %>%
  crossing(j = 1:4) %>%
  # Create a binary (0 or 1) to indicate where rating <= j
  mutate(rating_leq_j = as.numeric(rating) <= j) %>%
  group_by(j) %>%
  nest() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    mod = map(
      data,
      ~glm(rating_leq_j ~ 1 + contact,
           data = ., family = binomial(link = "logit"))
    ),
    mod_tidy = map(mod, tidy)
  ) %>%
  unnest(mod_tidy) %>%
  transmute(
    j, term,
    estimate_se = str_c(round(estimate, 2), " (", round(std.error, 2), ")")
  ) %>%
  spread(term, estimate_se) %>%
  left_join(
    tidy(clm_rating_contact) %>%
      transmute(
        j = as.integer(substr(term, 1, 1)),
        term = if_else(!is.na(j), "theta_j", term),
        estimate_se = str_c(round(estimate, 2), " (", round(std.error, 2), ")")
      ) %>%
      mutate(j = replace_na(j, 1)) %>%
      spread(term, estimate_se),
    by = "j"
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "Logistic regression",
              columns = vars(`(Intercept)`, contactyes.x)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "CLM",
              columns = vars(theta_j, contactyes.y)) %>%
  fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "")
```

The intercepts from the ordinary logistic regression correspond closely to the threshold parameters $\theta_j$ from the cumulative link model.
In the fixed effect of `contact` ($\beta_2$), first note the sign difference, and second notice that the estimate from CLM is about the average of the 4 estimates from logistic regression.
The advantage of the CLM is seen in the small standard error in the $\beta_2$ estimate.

To quote the primer:

>The cumulative logit model can be seen as the model that combines these four ordinary logistic regression models into a single model and therefore makes better use of the information in the data.

For the second model, we add the $\beta_1 \text{temp}_i$ term:

$$
\text{logit}(p(y_i \leq j)) = \theta_j - \beta_1 \text{temp}_i - \beta_2 \text{contact}_i
$$

```{r}
clm_rating_contact_temp <-
  clm(
    rating ~ contact + temp,
    data = wine, link = "logit"
  )
summary(clm_rating_contact_temp)
```

Both fixed effects (`contact` = yes and `temp` = warm) are strongly associated with higher probability of higher ratings.
The `summary` function provides p values from Wald tests, but more accurate likelihood ratio tests can be done via the `drop1` function, which evaluates each fixed effect while controlling the other:

```{r}
drop1(clm_rating_contact_temp, test = "Chisq")
```

Or the reverse via the `add1()` function, which evaluates each fixed effect while ignoring the other:

```{r}
# Fit the null model first
clm_rating_null <-
  clm(
    rating ~ 1,
    data = wine, link = "logit"
  )
add1(clm_rating_null, scope = ~ contact + temp, test = "Chisq")
```

Symmetric Wald confidence intervals can be extracted with `confint` or with `broom::tidy`:

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
tidy(clm_rating_contact_temp, conf.int = T, conf.type = "Wald") %>%
  ggp(aes(y = term, x = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high))
```

In these types of analyses, we are often interested in the odds ratios.
For the two categorical fixed effects, which have two levels each, the odds ratios $y \leq j$ comparing the two levels are:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{OR} &= \frac{\gamma_j (\text{temp} = \text{warm})}{\gamma_j (\text{temp} = \text{cold})} = \frac{\exp(\theta_j - \beta_1 - \beta_2 \text{contact})}{\exp (\theta_j - 0 - \beta_2 \text{contact}}) = \exp(\beta_1) \\
\text{OR} &= \frac{\gamma_j (\text{contact} = \text{yes})}{\gamma_j (\text{contact} = \text{no})} = \frac{\exp(\theta_j - \beta_1 \text{temp} - \beta_2 )}{\exp (\theta_j - \beta_1 \text{temp} - 0)}) = \exp(\beta_2)
\end{align}
$$

where we have introduced the shorthand $\gamma_j = \text{logit} (p(y \leq j))$.
Compute those odds ratios, and their corresponding Wald 95% CIs:

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
tidy(clm_rating_contact_temp, conf.int = T, conf.type = "Wald") %>%
  transmute(
    term,
    across(c(estimate, conf.low, conf.high), exp)
  ) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(vars(estimate, conf.low, conf.high), decimals = 2)
```

One last thing to check: does the model support an interaction between $\text{temp}_i$ and $\text{contact}_i$?

$$
\text{logit}(p(y_i \leq j)) = \theta_j - \beta_1 \text{temp}_i - \beta_2 \text{contact}_i - \beta_3 \text{temp}_i \text{contact}_i
$$

```{r}
clm_rating_contact_temp_inter <-
  clm(
    rating ~ contact * temp,
    data = wine, link = "logit"
  )
#drop1(clm_rating_contact_temp_inter, test = "Chisq") # this accomplishes the same thing as anova()
anova(clm_rating_contact_temp, clm_rating_contact_temp_inter)
```

The interaction term `contact:temp` is not supported by the data.

#### Comparison to linear model

Consider the following linear model which treats `rating` as continuous:

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{temp}_i + \beta_2 \text{contact}_i + \epsilon_i
$$

where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2)$.

```{r}
lm_rating_contact_temp <-
  lm(as.numeric(rating) ~ contact + temp, data = wine)
```


To compare this to a CLM, we must use the probit link:

```{r}
clm_rating_contact_temp_probit <-
  clm(
    rating ~ contact + temp,
    data = wine, link = "probit"
  )

tidy(clm_rating_contact_temp_probit) %>%
  filter(coefficient_type == "beta") %>%
  mutate(model = "CLM") %>%
  select(-coefficient_type) %>%
  bind_rows(
    tidy(lm_rating_contact_temp) %>%
      filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
      # Not sure why we need to divide by the residual SE here
      mutate(estimate = estimate / summary(lm_rating_contact_temp)$sigma,
             model = "LM")
  ) %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(vars(estimate, std.error, statistic), decimals = 2) %>%
  fmt(vars(p.value), fns = scales::pvalue)
```

The relative estimates from the linear model are lower than those from the CLM (probit link), indicating that the assumptions of the linear model are not met.
In particular, the distance between thresholds is not equidistant:

```{r}
diff(coef(clm_rating_contact_temp_probit)[1:4]) %>% round(2)
```

### Mixed effects model

Now that we have explored ordinal regression with just fixed effects, we will fit the following random effects model:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(p(y_i \leq j)) &= \theta_j - \beta_1 \text{temp}_i - \beta_2 \text{contact}_i - u( \text{judge}_i) \\
i &= 1, \dots n \; \; \; \; \; \; j = 1, \dots, J - 1
\end{align}
$$

where the judge effects are independent of $j$, and assumed normal: $u(\text{judge}_i) \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$.

Each judge has 8 `rating`s each (two per combination of `temp` and `contact`).
See if we can spot the `judge` variance in a plot of `rating`s:

```{r}
wine %>%
  count(judge, rating) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = judge, y = rating)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), color = "white") +
  cowplot::theme_half_open() +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Number of ratings by judge")
```

There is definitely some judge-specific variability in the perception of bitterness of wine.
`judge` 5, for instance, doesn't stray far from `rating` = 3, while `judge` 7 didn't consider any of the wines particularly bitter.

Fit the full model with `ordinal::clmm` and logit link:

```{r}
clmm_rating_contact_temp <-
  clmm(
    rating ~ temp + contact + (1|judge),
    data = wine, link = "logit"
  )
# This is an older function, which we need to run stats::profile later
clmm2_rating_contact_temp <-
  clmm2(
    rating ~ temp + contact, random = judge,
    data = wine, link = "logistic"
  )
summary(clmm_rating_contact_temp)
```

Compare model coefficients:

```{r}
tidy(clm_rating_contact_temp) %>%
  select(-coefficient_type) %>%
  mutate(model = "CLM") %>%
  bind_rows(
    tidy(clmm_rating_contact_temp) %>%
      select(-coefficient_type) %>%
      mutate(model = "CLMM")
  ) %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(vars(estimate, std.error, statistic), decimals = 2) %>%
  fmt(vars(p.value), fns = scales::pvalue)
```

Both fixed effect estimates $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are higher in the CLMM.
Use `anova` to compare the CLMM to the CLM:

```{r}
anova(
  clm_rating_contact_temp, clmm_rating_contact_temp
)
```

Unsurprisingly, the `judge` term makes a significant improvement to the fit.
We can extract profile confidence intervals on the variance $\sigma_u$ using `stats::profile`:

```{r}
profile(clmm2_rating_contact_temp,
        range = c(0.1, 4), nSteps = 30, trace = 0) %>%
  confint()
```

Note that these intervals are asymmetric ($\sigma_u$ = 1.31), unlike the less accurate Wald tests.
We can produce "best guess" estimates for `judge` effects using *conditional modes*:

```{r}
tibble(
  judge_effect = clmm_rating_contact_temp$ranef,
  cond_var = clmm_rating_contact_temp$condVar
) %>%
  mutate(
    judge = fct_reorder(factor(1:n()), judge_effect),
    conf.low = judge_effect - qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(cond_var),
    conf.high = judge_effect + qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(cond_var)
  ) %>%
  ggp(aes(y = judge, x = judge_effect)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high)) +
  cowplot::theme_minimal_vgrid()
```

#### Predictions

There are different ways to extract predicted probabilities.
First, and most obviously, with the `predict` function:

```{r}
wine %>%
  bind_cols(
    pred =  predict(
      # Have to use clmm2 for predict
      clmm2_rating_contact_temp,
      newdata = wine
    )
  ) %>%
  # These are predicted probabilities for the average judge, so we can
  #  exclude that variable
  distinct(rating, temp, contact, pred) %>%
  arrange(temp, contact, rating)
```

This only gives us predictions for `rating`, `temp` and `contact` values which exist in the data.
There is no predicted probability for `rating` > 3, `temp` cold and `contact` no, for example.
Another way is to pre-specify which values we want to predict:

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
nd <-
  crossing(
    temp = factor(c("cold", "warm")),
    contact = factor(c("no", "yes")),
    rating = factor(1:5, ordered = T)
  )
nd %>%
  bind_cols(pred = predict(clmm2_rating_contact_temp, nd)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = glue::glue("{temp}-{contact}"), y = pred, fill = rating)) +
  geom_col() +
  cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(x = "temp-contact")
```

We can also get model-estimated cumulative probabilities by considering the model coefficients.
For example, for a cold `temp` and `contact`, the cumulative probability of a bitterness `rating` $j$ or less:

$$
P(y_i \leq j) = \text{logit}^{-1} [\theta_j - \beta_2 \text{contact}_i]
$$

where we are considering the average judge ($u(\text{judge}_i) = 0$).
The inverse logit is $\text{logit}^{-1}(x) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-x))$, and can be calculated with `plogis` as a shorthand (`brms::inv_logit_scaled` is another).
We can subtract cumulative probabilities to get non-cumulative probabilities of a rating $j$.
For example, $j$ = 3:

```{r}
plogis(clmm_rating_contact_temp$Theta[3] - clmm_rating_contact_temp$beta[2]) -
  plogis(clmm_rating_contact_temp$Theta[2] - clmm_rating_contact_temp$beta[2])
```

which matches the value calculated previously using `predict`.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Just checking the plogis() calculation
tidy(clmm_rating_contact_temp) %>%
  select(term, estimate) %>%
  filter(term != "tempwarm") %>%
  spread(term, estimate) %>%
  gather(term, estimate, -contactyes) %>%
  mutate(
    prob_manual = 1 / (1 + exp(-estimate + contactyes)),
    prob_plogis = plogis(estimate - contactyes)
  )
```


#### Choice of link function

So far, we have used the logit link (and briefly the probit link to compare estimates with linear regression).
The links available to `ordinal::clmm` are logit, probit, cloglog, loglog, and cauchit.

We can fit the CLMM using all of these links and compare log-likelihoods:

```{r warning=F}
wine %>%
  nest(everything()) %>%
  crossing(
    link = c("logit", "probit", "cloglog", "loglog", "cauchit")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    mod = map2(
      data, link,
      ~clmm(
        rating ~ 1 + contact + temp + (1|judge),
        data = .x, link = .y
      )
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    mod_glance = map(mod, glance)
  ) %>%
  unnest(mod_glance) %>%
  select(link, logLik, AIC, BIC) %>%
  arrange(logLik)
```

The probit model appears to be the best description of the data.

We can also consider the effect of "flexible" vs "equidistant" thresholds:

```{r warning=F}
wine %>%
  nest(everything()) %>%
  crossing(
    link = c("logit", "probit", "cloglog", "loglog", "cauchit"),
    threshold = c("flexible", "equidistant")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    mod = pmap(
      list(data, link, threshold),
      function(a, b, c) {
        clmm(
          rating ~ 1 + contact + temp + (1|judge),
          data = a, link = b, threshold = c
        )
      }
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    mod_glance = map(mod, glance)
  ) %>%
  unnest(mod_glance) %>%
  select(link, threshold, logLik, edf, AIC, BIC) %>%
  arrange(logLik)
```

Note the change in degrees of freedom, resulting in the equidistant probit model having the lowest BIC.
In terms of log likelihood, however, flexible always outperform equidistant thresholds.

# Conclusion

Thanks to detailed documentation, fitting cumulative link (mixed) models is very easy with `ordinal`.
In this post, we first learned the theoretical basis for these models, then worked through examples using `wine` bitterness ratings from multiple judges.

In the next post, I'll explore the Bayesian approach to ordinal regression with the `brms` package.
