@article{Fong2010,
abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in popularity due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple levels of dependency and model different data types. For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.},

@article{Halekoh2006,
abstract = {This paper describes the core features of the R package geepack, which implements the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach for fitting marginal generalized linear models to clustered data. Clustered data arise in many applications such as longitudinal data and repeated measures. The GEE approach focuses on models for the mean of the correlated observations within clusters without fully specifying the joint distribution of the observations. It has been widely used in statistical practice. This paper illustrates the application of the GEE approach with geepack through an example of clustered binary data.},

@article{Lee2004,
abstract = {There has existed controversy about the use of marginal and conditional models, particularly in the analysis of data from longitudinal studies. We show that alleged differences in the behavior of parameters in so-called marginal and conditional models are based on a failure to compare like with like. In particular, these seemingly apparent differences are meaningless because they are mainly caused by preimposed unidentifiable constraints on the random effects in models. We discuss the advantages of conditional models over marginal models. We regard the conditional model as fundamental, from which marginal predictions can be made.},

In this annotated bibliography we describe the development of the GEE and its extensions during the last decade. Additionally, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different parametrisations that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we review regression diagnostic techniques and approaches for dealing with missing data. We give an insight to the different fields of application in biometry. We also describe the software available for the GEE.},

abstract = {Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) is a marginal model popularly applied for longitudinal/clustered data analysis in clinical trials or biomedical studies. We provide a systematic review on GEE including basic concepts as well as several recent developments due to practical challenges in real applications. The topics including the selection of “working” correlation structure, sample size and power calculation, and the issue of informative cluster size are covered because these aspects play important roles in GEE utilization and its statistical inference. A brief summary and discussion of potential research interests regarding GEE are provided in the end.},
