This post is a re-creation of the 2020 preprint [@Riou2020].

* The PDF is  available
[here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031104v1.full.pdf).
* Data and code are availalbe [here](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr).
* Andrew Gelman's blog post on the paper is
[here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/03/07/coronavirus-age-specific-fatality-ratio-estimated-using-stan/).

The reason I'm reviewing it is because (A) COVID-19 is scary and (B) I wanted to learn more Stan, or specifically, the limits of complexity in Stan.

Import the data:

```{r}

  )
japan_clean <-

# Introduction

* Overall case fatality ratio (CFR): the proportion of all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected cases that will die as a result of the disease.
* A crude CFR of 2.3% was estimated based on 1023 deaths out of 44672 confirmed cases.
* Difficult to interpret due to
    * likely under-ascertainment of mild or asymptomatic cases and
    * right-censoring of cases with respect to the time delay from illness onset to death.
* Other analyses have reported estimates of 7.2%, 5.3%, 18%, and 1%.
* The authors attempted to fit a dynamic transmission model to reported data of confirmed cases and deaths in Hubei. They obtained adjusted and age-specific estimates of the overall CFR of COVID-19 among both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the Hubei province until 11 February 2020.

# The COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China

>Human-to-human transmission occured at a high rate in Wuhan and other areas of the Hubei province, leading to an exponential growth of incidence (Figure 1A).

To re-create Figure 1, we use the provided `confirmed_cases` data:

```{r}
head(confirmed_cases)
```

There are four count variables: `confirmed_cases_china`, `confirmed_cases_outside_hubei_with_link`, `confirmed_cases_outside_hubei_without_link`, and `confirmed_cases_hubei`.
Create a `date` type object, and plot the counts:

```{r fig.width=8}
confirmed_cases  <-
  confirmed_cases %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(
      glue("{year}-{month}-{day}")      
    )
  )
confirmed_cases %>%
  gather(var, count, confirmed_cases_china:confirmed_cases_hubei) %>%
  ggp(aes(x = date, y = count)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ var, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, 0)))
```

The extra count of deaths in Hubei come from an R query package [nCov2019](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019), which were hard-coded by the authors into this list:

```{r}
reported_deaths <- c(
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 14, 13,
  21, 23, 23, 33, 38, 40, 40, 50, 56, 58, 64, 64, 76, 78, 85, 95, 85
)
```

There are `r length(reported_deaths)` time points in the `reported_deaths` data, but the `confirmed_cases` data spans `r nrow(confirmed_cases)`.
If we assume that these `r length(reported_deaths)` are the most recent, then they correspond to the date range 
`r min(tail(confirmed_cases$date, length(reported_deaths)))` to
`r max(confirmed_cases$date)`.
Add this to the `confirmed_cases` data, and fill for earlier dates:

```{r}
confirmed_cases <-
  confirmed_cases %>%
  left_join(
    tibble(
      reported_deaths = reported_deaths,
      date = seq.Date(
        min(tail(confirmed_cases$date, length(reported_deaths))),
        max(confirmed_cases$date),
        "days"
      )
    ),
    by = "date"
  ) %>%
  mutate(reported_deaths = replace_na(reported_deaths, 0))
```

Note that this corresponds to the first death occuring on `r min(filter(confirmed_cases, reported_deaths > 0)$date)`, but the first was reported to occur on
[January 9th in Wuhan](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-reports-first-death-in-wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak).

Create Figure 1A with the `confirmed_cases_hubei` variable:

```{r fig1a}
fig1a <-
  confirmed_cases %>%
  ggp(aes(x = date, y = confirmed_cases_hubei)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  geom_col(aes(y = reported_deaths), fill = "firebrick", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-01-20"), lty = 2, size = 1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = max(confirmed_cases$date), lty = 2, size = 1) + 
  scale_y_continuous("N", limits = c(0, 3000),
                     expand = expansion(c(0, 0))) +
  labs(x = "Time")
fig1a
```

To construct the three subplots for Figure 1B, we use hard-coded data, binned by age, from the
[worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/china-demographics/) and 
[Chinese CDC Weekly](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr/blob/master/data/chineseCDC2020.pdf):

```{r fig1b}
fig1b_data <-
  tibble(
    age_range = factor(
      c(
        "0-9", "10-19", "20-29", "30-39", "40-49",
        "50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80+"
      ),
      ordered = T
    )
  ) %>%
  # Chinese age_distribution from worldometer
  bind_cols(
    `Chinese population` = c(
      83932437 + 86735183,
      84262751 + 82341859,
      87158167+ 97989003,
      128738970 + 100091455, 
      96274146 + 119837617,

      77514139 + 74149766,

      16181417 + 7581777 + 2305024 + 475193 + 74692
    )
  ) %>%

  bind_cols(
    `Confirmed cases` = c(
      416, 549, 3619, 7600, 8571, 10008, 8583, 3918, 1408
    )
  ) %>%
  # Reported deaths from CDC
  bind_cols(
    `Reported deaths` = c(
      0, 1, 7, 18, 38, 130, 309, 312, 208
    )
  ) %>%
  gather(var, count, -age_range) %>%
  group_by(var) %>%
  mutate(prop = count / sum(count))
fig1b <- fig1b_data %>%
  ggp(aes(y = age_range, x = prop)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~var) +
  scale_x_continuous("Proportion", labels = scales::percent,
                     expand = expansion(c(0, 0))) +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, expand = expansion(c(0, 0)))
fig1b
```

Data for Figure 1C come from the [Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases](https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9407-covid-dp-fe-01.html), and a cleaned version of the data (`japan_clean`) was provided by the authors:

```{r}
japan_clean
```

The `age` variable has some non-numeric variables: `r glue_collapse(unique(japan_clean$age[is.na(as.numeric(japan_clean$age))]), sep = " and ")`.
The data are already seemingly binned into decades (values of 10, 20, 30, etc.), but we will re-label to match the figure (values of 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc.):

```{r warning=FALSE}
japan_clean <- 
  japan_clean %>%
  mutate(
    # Impute as the midpoint
    age = as.numeric(str_replace(age, "0-10", "5"))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    age_range = cut(
      age,
      breaks = c(0, 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 100),
      labels = levels(fig1b_data$age_range)
    )
  )
```

This cleaned data doesn't have the sympomatic status, however.
Looking through the [source code](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr/blob/master/output_paper.R), I found the following hard-coded values for the Diamond Pricess ship:

```{r}
diamond_symptoms <-
  tibble(
    symptomatic = c(0, 2, 25, 27, 19, 28, 76, 95, 29),
    asymptomatic = c(1, 3, 3, 7, 8, 31, 101, 139, 25),
    age_range = factor(levels(fig1b_data$age_range), ordered = T)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    symptomatic_prop = symptomatic / (symptomatic + asymptomatic),
    prop_inf = qbeta(0.025, symptomatic+1, asymptomatic+1),
    prop_sup = qbeta(0.975, symptomatic+1, asymptomatic+1),
    var = "Symptomatics"
  )
fig1c <-
  diamond_symptoms %>%
  ggp(aes(x = symptomatic_prop, y = age_range)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = prop_inf, xmax = prop_sup), size = 1, width = 0.3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, lty = 2, size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~var) +
  scale_x_continuous("Proportion", expand = expansion(c(0, 0.02)),
                     labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, expand = expansion(c(0, 0)))
fig1c
```

Note that the credible intervals are generated using `qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), count1, count2)`.

Now we can compile all of Figure 1:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
fig1a + fig1b + fig1c +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1) +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
```


# An age-structured model of COVID-19 transmission and mortality

An age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-remove (SEIR) compartmental model was used to simulate the dynamics of the epidemic with:

* data from 2020-01-01 to 2020-02-11,
* a distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections,
* age stratified into 10-year ranges (0-9 years, ..., 80+ years),
* parameter assumptions, identical across ages):
    * incubation period of 5.6 days,
    * 49% of infected people develop symptoms and become infectious (the remaining are asymptomatic and do not transmit further),
    * time from onset to removal of 2.9 days
    
![](/post/2020-03-08-paper-review-adjusted-age-specific-case-fatality-ratio-during-the-covid-19-epidemic_files/riou2020_figure2.png){width=800px}

After 2020-02-20, transmission decrease was modeled using a sigmoid function with four parameters:

* initial transmission rate,
* decrease in transmission due to control measures,
* time delay between implementation and effect, and
* slope of this decrease.

It was assumed that symptomatic people had an age-specific case-fatality rate and that time from onset to death followed a log-normal distribution with mean 20.2 days and SD 11.6.
Thus, number of deaths could be estimated after 2020-02-11.

The model was fitted to four data sets from the CCDC report:

1. the number of confirmed cases by day of disease onset,
2. the number of deaths by day of occurence,
3. the age distribution of all confirmed cases, and
4. the age distribution of all deaths.

Some additional assumptions and details:

* assumed that all deaths were reported, 
* assumed that all symptomatic cases among people 80+ were reported.
* For the other age groups, the underreporting of symptomatic cases was modeled with an age-dependent reporting rate.
* Negative binomial distributions were used to describe the number of reported cases and deaths, and
* multinomial distributions to describe the distribution of cases and deaths over age groups.

## Walking through the R code

With all of this detail in mind, go step-by-step through the `run_models.R`:

```{r eval=F}
source("data_management.R")
source("setup.R")

# Model 10 ----------------------------------------------------------

# get gamma from discretizing onset_to_death in Linton
linton_mean = 20.2
linton_sd = 11.6

get_par_lnorm = function(m,s) {
  mu = log(m) - 1/2*log((s/m)^2+1)
  sigma = sqrt(log((s/m)^2+1))
  return(list(mu=mu,sigma=sigma))
}
linton_pars = get_par_lnorm(linton_mean,linton_sd)
```

After sourcing some pre-processing files, define the parameters of the log-normal distribution of time from onset to death are defined.
These values give us:

```{r}
linton_mean <- 20.2
linton_sd <- 11.6

mu <- log(linton_mean) - 0.5 * log((linton_sd / linton_mean)^2 + 1)
sigma <- sqrt(log((linton_sd / linton_mean)^2 + 1))
mu; sigma
```

Plot the lognormal distribution:

```{r}
tibble(
  x = seq(0, 50, 0.1),
  d = dlnorm(x, meanlog = mu, sdlog = sigma)
) %>%
  ggp(aes(x, d)) +
  geom_line()
```

Density looks reasonable.
If we take many random samples, we should recover the original 20.2 ± 11.6:

```{r}
tibble(
  val = rlnorm(n = 10000, meanlog = mu, sdlog = sigma)
) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(val), sd = sd(val))
```

The next bit of code uses the Linton parameters to compute 60 differences in probabilities through `plnorm`:

```{r eval=F}
gamma = numeric(60)
for(i in 1:60) {
  gamma[i] = plnorm(i+.5,linton_pars$mu,linton_pars$sigma)-plnorm(i-.5,linton_pars$mu,linton_pars$sigma)
}
gamma = gamma/sum(gamma)
plot(density(rlnorm(1000,linton_pars$mu,linton_pars$sigma)))
lines(gamma,col="red")
```

This `gamma` variable is the $\gamma$ variable from Figure 2: the delay from disease onset to death discretized by day.
So I think these are probabilities of death (or $\gamma$) for 1 to 60 days from disease onset:

```{r}
tibble(
  i = 1:60
) %>%
  mutate(
    gamma = plnorm(i + 0.5, mu, sigma) - plnorm(i - 0.5, mu, sigma)
  ) %>%
  # Normalize
  mutate(gamma = gamma / sum(gamma)) %>%
  ggp(aes(i, gamma)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Day from disease onset", y = expression(paste("p(", gamma, ")")))
```

```{r eval=F}
# Format data and set priors
data_list_model10 = list(
  time_lag=100,
  K=9,
  age_dist=age_dist,
  pop_t = pop_t,
  t0=0,
  t_data = t_data,
  tmax =tmax,
  tmax2 = tmax,
  tswitch = tswitch,
  S=S,
  ts = 1:S,
  D = D,
  incidence_cases = incidence_cases,
  incidence_deaths = incidence_deaths,
  agedistr_cases = cases_tmax,
  agedistr_deaths = mort_tmax,
  p_beta=1,
  p_eta=c(1,1),
  p_pi=c(1,999),
  p_incubation=5.6, # Incubation including WR (Linton)
  p_infectious=2.9, # Infectious period (Liu)
  p_psi=0.49, # Diamond princess
  p_epsilon=c(1,1),
  p_phi = 1/100,
  p_rho=c(1,1),
  p_xi=1,
  p_nu=1/5,
  G=60,
  p_gamma=gamma,
  inference=0,
  doprint=0
)
```

This list are the inputs to the Stan model, for which we will refer to `data_management`:

```{r eval=F}
day_start = as.Date("2019-12-30")
day_data = as.Date("2019-12-08")
if(day_data<=day_start) day_data = day_start + 2 # 2020-01-01
day_tmax = as.Date("2020-02-11")
day_tswitch = as.Date("2020-01-23")
time_lag = 100

t0 = 0
tmax = as.numeric(day_tmax-day_start) # day 43
S = tmax+time_lag # day 143
ts = 1:S # days 1:143
t_data = as.numeric(day_data-day_start) # day 2
D = tmax-t_data+1 # 42 days
tswitch = as.numeric(day_tswitch-day_start) # day 24
```

A bit confusing without comments.
It seems that the "start day" (`day_start`) was different from the "data start day" (`day_data`), which evaluated to 2020-01-01 in the above code.

I first thought that `day_tswitch` = 2020-01-23 refered to the "Control measures implemented" in Figure 1A, but this is actually 2020-01-20.
Perhaps this date corresponds to the traffic restrictions, quote below:

>On 20 January, Chinese authorities implemented strict control measures in the Hubei province, including contact tracing aimed at identifying , treating and isolating cases and quarantining contacts, extension of holidays, temperature checks before accessing public areas, cancellation of mass gatherings and the promotion of extreme social distancing [10]. Three days later, a cordon sanitaire was imposed, with strict traffic restrictions. From

`time_lag` extends the time frame by beyond `tmax` an extra 100 days, to `r as.Date("2020-02-11") + 100`, which isn't actually plotted in Figure 3A and 3C, but maybe the axis was cutoff in April.

The calculated values, as I understand them:

* `tmax` is the number of days from start to `tmax` (43),
* `S` is the total number of days considered, 100 days beyond `tmax`,
* `ts` is a vector of those 43+100 days,
* `t_data` is the day on which data starts being collected (day 2),
* `D` is the number of days with data + 1 (42)
* `tswitch` is the day on which control measures + traffic restrictions were in place (24)

With that in mind, I'll use some descriptive variable names:

```{r}
start_date = as.Date("2019-12-30")
data_start_date <- start_date + 2 # 2020-01-01
end_date <- as.Date("2020-02-11")
controls_date <- as.Date("2020-01-23")
extra_days <- 100

start_day <- 0
end_day <- as.numeric(end_date - start_date) # 43
extra_end_day <- end_day + extra_days # 143
days <- 1:extra_end_day # 1:143
data_start_day <- as.numeric(data_start_date - start_date) # 2
data_days <- end_day - data_start_day + 1 # 42
controls_day <- as.numeric(controls_date - start_date) # 24
```

Moving on:

```{r eval=F}
# Age distribution in China for 9 age classes ---------
# (https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/china-demographics/) 

age_dist<- c(
  83932437 + 86735183,
  84262751 + 82341859,
  87158167+ 97989003,
  128738970 + 100091455, 
  96274146 + 119837617,
  123445382 + 98740491,
  77514139 + 74149766,
  44949689 + 26544616,
  16181417 + 7581777 + 2305024 + 475193 + 74692)
age_dist<-age_dist/sum(age_dist)
```

This is the data we hard-coded earlier for Figure 1B, `fig1b_data`; specifically, the first panel of "Chinese population".

```{r eval=F}
# Population in Hubei ---------
# (National Bureau of Statistics of China) 
pop_t = 59020000
```

As it says in the header, this is simply the population of Hubei.

```{r eval=F}
# Case incidence in Hubei up to 2020-02-11 ---------
# (Chinese CDC Weekly, The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak...)

confirmed_cases = read.csv("data/confirmed_cases.csv") %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  mutate(date=ymd(paste(year,month,day,sep="-"))) %>%
  filter(date>=day_data)
incidence_cases = pull(confirmed_cases,confirmed_cases_hubei)
```

This is the number of cases over time in Hubei, as shown in Figure 1A, but just taking data from the data start day `r data_start_date` and later.

```{r eval=F}
incidence_deaths = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 14, 13, 21, 23, 23, 33, 38, 40, 40, 50, 56, 58, 64,
                     64, 76, 78, 85, 95, 85)
```

These were the death counts over time in Hubei, also in Figure 1A.
The number of hard-coded values above is 42, which is the correct number of days of data.

```{r eval=F}
# Age distribution of cases in mainland China as of 2020-02-11 --------- 
# (Chinese CDC Weekly, The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak...)

cases_tmax = c(416,549,3619,7600,8571,10008,8583,3918,1408)
prop_cases_tmax = cases_tmax / sum(cases_tmax)

# Age distribution of deaths in mainland China as of 2020-02-11 --------- 
# (Chinese CDC Weekly, The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak...)

mort_tmax = c(0,1,7,18,38,130,309,312,208)
prop_mort_tmax = mort_tmax / sum(mort_tmax)
```

This last bit of coded is the hard-coded values for the "Confirmed cases" and "Reported deaths" panels of Figure 1B.

Grab all of this data:

```{r}
chinese_age_dist <- fig1b_data %>%
  filter(var == "Chinese population") %>%
  pull(prop)
hubei_population <- 59020000
incidence_cases_hubei <- confirmed_cases %>%
  filter(date >= data_start_date) %>%
  pull(confirmed_cases_hubei)
incidence_deaths_hubei <- confirmed_cases %>%
  filter(date >= data_start_date) %>%
  pull(reported_deaths)
chinese_cases_dist <- fig1b_data %>%
  filter(var == "Confirmed cases") %>%
  pull(prop)
chinese_deaths_dist <- fig1b_data %>%
  filter(var == "Reported deaths") %>%
  pull(prop)
```


Now we can start commenting on some of these values:

```{r eval=F}
# Format data and set priors
data_list_model10 = list(
  time_lag=100, # extra days after tmax
  K=9, # number of age groups
  age_dist=age_dist,
  pop_t = pop_t,
  t0=0, # start time
  t_data = t_data, # the day on which data begins (2)
  tmax =tmax, # maximum number of days (43)
  tmax2 = tmax, # same
  tswitch = tswitch, # the day with control measurse + traffic restrictions (24)
  S=S, # number of days tmax + time_lag (143)
  ts = 1:S, # vector of those days
