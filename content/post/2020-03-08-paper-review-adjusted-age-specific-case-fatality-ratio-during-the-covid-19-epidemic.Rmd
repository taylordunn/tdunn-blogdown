# Introduction

* Overall case fatality ratio (CFR): the proportion of all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected cases that will die as a result of the disease.
* A crude CFR of 2.3% was estimated based on 1023 deaths out of 44672 confirmed cases.
* Difficult to interpret due to
    * likely under-ascertainment of mild or asymptomatic cases and
    * right-censoring of cases with respect to the time delay from illness onset to death.
* Other analyses have reported estimates of 7.2%, 5.3%, 18%, and 1%.
* The authors attempted to fit a dynamic transmission model to reported data of confirmed cases and deaths in Hubei. They obtained adjusted and age-specific estimates of the overall CFR of COVID-19 among both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the Hubei province until 11 February 2020.

# The COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China

>Human-to-human transmission occured at a high rate in Wuhan and other areas of the Hubei province, leading to an exponential growth of incidence (Figure 1A).

To re-create Figure 1, we use the provided `confirmed_cases` data:

```{r}
head(confirmed_cases)
```

There are four count variables: `confirmed_cases_china`, `confirmed_cases_outside_hubei_with_link`, `confirmed_cases_outside_hubei_without_link`, and `confirmed_cases_hubei`.
Create a `date` type object, and plot the counts:

```{r fig.width=8}
confirmed_cases  <-
  confirmed_cases %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(
      glue("{year}-{month}-{day}")      
    )
  )
confirmed_cases %>%
  gather(var, count, confirmed_cases_china:confirmed_cases_hubei) %>%
  ggp(aes(x = date, y = count)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ var, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, 0)))
```

The extra count of deaths in Hubei come from an R query package [nCov2019](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019), which were hard-coded by the authors into this list:

```{r}
reported_deaths <- c(
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 14, 13,
  21, 23, 23, 33, 38, 40, 40, 50, 56, 58, 64, 64, 76, 78, 85, 95, 85
)
```

There are `r length(reported_deaths)` time points in the `reported_deaths` data, but the `confirmed_cases` data spans `r nrow(confirmed_cases)`.
If we assume that these `r length(reported_deaths)` are the most recent, then they correspond to the date range 
`r min(tail(confirmed_cases$date, length(reported_deaths)))` to
`r max(confirmed_cases$date)`.
Add this to the `confirmed_cases` data, and fill for earlier dates:

```{r}
confirmed_cases <-
  confirmed_cases %>%
  left_join(
    tibble(
      reported_deaths = reported_deaths,
      date = seq.Date(
        min(tail(confirmed_cases$date, length(reported_deaths))),
        max(confirmed_cases$date),
        "days"
      )
    ),
    by = "date"
  ) %>%
  mutate(reported_deaths = replace_na(reported_deaths, 0))
```

Note that this corresponds to the first death occuring on `r min(filter(confirmed_cases, reported_deaths > 0)$date)`, but the first was reported to occur on
[January 9th in Wuhan](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-reports-first-death-in-wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak).

Create Figure 1A with the `confirmed_cases_hubei` variable:

```{r fig1a}
fig1a <-
  confirmed_cases %>%
  ggp(aes(x = date, y = confirmed_cases_hubei)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  geom_col(aes(y = reported_deaths), fill = "firebrick", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-01-20"), lty = 2, size = 1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = max(confirmed_cases$date), lty = 2, size = 1) + 
  scale_y_continuous("N", limits = c(0, 3000),
                     expand = expansion(c(0, 0))) +
  labs(x = "Time")
fig1a
```

To construct the three subplots for Figure 1B, we use hard-coded data, binned by age, from the
[worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/china-demographics/) and 
[Chinese CDC Weekly](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr/blob/master/data/chineseCDC2020.pdf):

```{r fig1b}
fig1b_data <-
  tibble(
    age_range = factor(
      c(
        "0-9", "10-19", "20-29", "30-39", "40-49",
        "50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80+"
      ),
      ordered = T
    )
  ) %>%
  # Chinese age_distribution from worldometer
  bind_cols(
    `Chinese population` = c(
      83932437 + 86735183,
      84262751 + 82341859,
      87158167+ 97989003,
      128738970 + 100091455, 
      96274146 + 119837617,
      123445382 + 98740491,
      77514139 + 74149766,
      44949689 + 26544616,
      16181417 + 7581777 + 2305024 + 475193 + 74692
    )
  ) %>%
  # Confirmed cases from CDC
  bind_cols(
    `Confirmed cases` = c(
      416, 549, 3619, 7600, 8571, 10008, 8583, 3918, 1408
    )
  ) %>%
  # Reported deaths from CDC
  bind_cols(
    `Reported deaths` = c(
      0, 1, 7, 18, 38, 130, 309, 312, 208
    )
  ) %>%
  gather(var, count, -age_range) %>%
  group_by(var) %>%
  mutate(prop = count / sum(count))
fig1b <- fig1b_data %>%
  ggp(aes(y = age_range, x = prop)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~var) +
  scale_x_continuous("Proportion", labels = scales::percent,
                     expand = expansion(c(0, 0))) +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, expand = expansion(c(0, 0)))
fig1b
```

Data for Figure 1C come from the [Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases](https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9407-covid-dp-fe-01.html), and a cleaned version of the data (`japan_clean`) was provided by the authors:

```{r}
japan_clean
```

The `age` variable has some non-numeric variables: `r glue_collapse(unique(japan_clean$age[is.na(as.numeric(japan_clean$age))]), sep = " and ")`.
The data are already seemingly binned into decades (values of 10, 20, 30, etc.), but we will re-label to match the figure (values of 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc.):

```{r warning=FALSE}
japan_clean <- 
  japan_clean %>%
  mutate(
    # Impute as the midpoint
    age = as.numeric(str_replace(age, "0-10", "5"))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    age_range = cut(
      age,
      breaks = c(0, 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 100),
      labels = levels(fig1b_data$age_range)
    )
  )
```

This cleaned data doesn't have the sympomatic status, however.
Looking through the [source code](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr/blob/master/output_paper.R), I found the following hard-coded values for the Diamond Pricess ship:

```{r}
diamond_symptoms <-
  tibble(
    symptomatic = c(0, 2, 25, 27, 19, 28, 76, 95, 29),
    asymptomatic = c(1, 3, 3, 7, 8, 31, 101, 139, 25),
    age_range = factor(levels(fig1b_data$age_range), ordered = T)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    symptomatic_prop = symptomatic / (symptomatic + asymptomatic),
    prop_inf = qbeta(0.025, symptomatic+1, asymptomatic+1),
    prop_sup = qbeta(0.975, symptomatic+1, asymptomatic+1),
    var = "Symptomatics"
  )
fig1c <-
  diamond_symptoms %>%
  ggp(aes(x = symptomatic_prop, y = age_range)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = prop_inf, xmax = prop_sup), size = 1, width = 0.3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, lty = 2, size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~var) +
  scale_x_continuous("Proportion", expand = expansion(c(0, 0.02)),
                     labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, expand = expansion(c(0, 0)))
fig1c
```

Note that the credible intervals are generated using `qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), count1, count2)`.

Now we can compile all of Figure 1:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
fig1a + fig1b + fig1c +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1) +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
```


# An age-structured model of COVID-19 transmission and mortality

An age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-remove (SEIR) compartmental model was used to simulate the dynamics of the epidemic with:

* data from 2020-01-01 to 2020-02-11,
* a distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections,
* age stratified into 10-year ranges (0-9 years, ..., 80+ years),
* parameter assumptions, identical across ages):
    * incubation period of 5.6 days,
    * 49% of infected people develop symptoms and become infectious (the remaining are asymptomatic and do not transmit further),
    * time from onset to removal of 2.9 days
    
![](/post/2020-03-08-paper-review-adjusted-age-specific-case-fatality-ratio-during-the-covid-19-epidemic_files/riou2020_figure2.png){width=800px}

After 2020-02-20, transmission decrease was modeled using a sigmoid function with four parameters:

* initial transmission rate,
* decrease in transmission due to control measures,
* time delay between implementation and effect, and
* slope of this decrease.

It was assumed that symptomatic people had an age-specific case-fatality rate and that time from onset to death followed a log-normal distribution with mean 20.2 days and SD 11.6.
Thus, number of deaths could be estimated after 2020-02-11.

The model was fitted to four data sets from the CCDC report:

1. the number of confirmed cases by day of disease onset,
2. the number of deaths by day of occurence,
3. the age distribution of all confirmed cases, and
4. the age distribution of all deaths.
