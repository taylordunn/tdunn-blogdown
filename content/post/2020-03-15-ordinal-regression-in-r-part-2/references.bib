abstract = {Ordinal variables, while extremely common in Psychology, are almost exclusively analysed 10 with statistical models that falsely assume them to be metric. This practice can lead to 11 distorted effect size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the 12 application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under 13 study. In this tutorial article, we first explain the three major ordinal model classes; the 14 cumulative, sequential and adjacent category models. We then show how to fit ordinal 15 models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on stem cell 16 opinions and marriage time courses. Two appendices provide detailed mathematical 17 derivations of the models, and a third practical example that connects ordinal models to 18 Signal Detection Theory with confidence rating data. Ordinal models provide better 19 theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend 20 their widespread adoption in Psychology. 21},
